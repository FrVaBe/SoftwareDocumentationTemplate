Software Documentation Template
===============================

This repository contains a simple Software Documentation Template (see [SDT.md](SDT.md)).<br/> 
The topics handled in this document should make it possible

- to maintain the software
- to use the software
- to integrate and operate the software

It only includes top level chapters. Few content hints  describe what information can be included in a section. All the rest (like further sub chapters) depend on the concrete project and should be configured as required.
